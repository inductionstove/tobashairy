\maketitle
This world is not different from hell.
\\Morality is not different from a shell.
\\There is no justice, no sense of right.
\\No safety whether day or night.
\\\\Crime is an adjective of human society,
\\Humans have lost all traces of humanity.
\\Suicides are moaned as murders when martyrs we neglect,
\\Where is equality in obsession with one's cast and sect?
\\\\I have lost faith in such tainted eyes,
\\We live in nothing but a world of lies.
\\\\Humans think of themselves as civil,
\\Nature laughs at the irony knowing that we are the devil.
\\Religion talks of a hell for the departed,
\\Is this world less than a hell, deficient of the pure hearted?
\\\\Nature happens to be foreign to justice.
\\Nothing ought to be, it just is.
\\Life is but a play of an atom's valence shell,
\\How does it matter, heaven or hell?
