\begin{document}
I run through every page,
\\
Every word, ever character,
\\
In search of the solution.
\\
I run through every image,
\\
Every surd, every chapter,
\\
But I do not find the solution.
\\
\\
Bless me, Thy Highness, or curse me.
\\
Kill me or give me life.
\\
But show me the solution.
\\
\\
Let me live the journey but take me to the destination.
\\
Let not one thought of mine be wasted as procrastination.
\\
\\Take me to the end, powers of logic, so that I can start again.
\\
I plead to you, Thy Highness, let my efforts not be in vain.
