One morning in heaven,
\\As the clock struck eleven,
\\God walked up to the lake.
\\
\\For the first time ever, he was not accompanied by his beautiful wife.
\\He took the chance to look into his reflection, to see how he looked for all his life.
\\
\\What does he see? On the other side stood the devil!
\\How could the reflection of God be the culmination of evil?
\\
\\`Ich bin Du,' it said, `und Du bist Ich.'
\\`Nonsense!' God said in his mind.
\\'You are not one of my kind!' He shouted to his reflection.
\\
\\The devil was overwhelmed with laughter,
\\For even God had not known that \textit{He} was the monster.
